The Institute of Medicine recommends approximately 3.0 liters (about 13 cups) of total water per day during pregnancy, which is higher than the 2.7 liters for non-pregnant women.

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #333; font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: 500;">Why Water Intake Matters: Prevent Dehydration and Stay Healthy 💧</h3>
                    
                    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">Water is essential for life. It covers 71% of the planet's surface, and our bodies contain around 50-75% water. We can survive only a couple of days without water. Proper hydration is critical for health, and its deficit can cause serious problems including headaches, fatigue, reduced athletic performance, and in severe cases, confusion and seizures.</p>
                    
                    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">Our Daily Water Intake Calculator helps you determine the approximate amount of water you need to drink per day to prevent dehydration. It is based on the Adequate Intake (AI) measure from the Institute of Medicine, which represents the median total water intake from U.S. survey data. These values include water from both beverages and food.</p>
                    
                    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">The calculator shows both total water intake (from beverages and food) and the amount you should consume specifically in the form of beverages. Approximately 81% of total water intake comes from beverages, while the remaining 19% comes from the water contained in food. This distinction is important because most people focus on drinking water but may not realize that many foods also contribute to their daily hydration needs.</p>
                    
                    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">For adults, the daily Adequate Intake for men and women is 3.7 L and 2.7 L per day respectively. However, these are general guidelines, and your actual needs may vary based on physical activity, climate, body size, metabolism rate, and general health condition. During exercise, you may need additional water—typically 17-25 oz (500-750 ml) per hour of exercise.</p>
                    
                    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">The most important rule is to listen to your body. When you feel thirsty, have a drink. Check your urine color—the lighter it is, the more hydrated you are. Pay special attention during increased sweating (exercise, hot weather) or illness (diarrhea, vomiting), when you'll need more fluids than usual.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer" style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">A: Daily water intake recommendations vary by age and gender. Adult men need approximately 3.7 liters (13 cups) of total water per day, while adult women need about 2.7 liters (9 cups). However, remember that about 81% comes from beverages and 19% from food. This means men should drink about 3.0 L (13 cups) and women should drink about 2.2 L (9 cups) of beverages daily.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer" style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">A: Common signs of dehydration include headache, stomachache, general discomfort, reduced strength and athletic performance, loss of appetite, decreased urine volume with darker color, unexplained tiredness, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures. The easiest way to check your hydration status is to look at your urine color—light yellow or clear means you're well hydrated.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer" style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">A: During exercise, it's recommended to drink 17-25 oz (approximately 500-750 ml) per hour. This may vary according to your weight and weather conditions. Lighter weight athletes or those exercising in cooler temperatures need 16-18 oz (~475-530 ml) per hour, while heavier athletes or those in hot conditions may need up to 28 oz (~830 ml) per hour. Remember to start hydrated by drinking fluids slowly 4 hours before exercise (5-7 mL per kilogram of body weight).</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer" style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">A: While rare, it is possible to drink too much water, a condition called hyponatremia. This usually comes from an imbalance between water and electrolytes rather than simply too much water. However, healthy kidneys can filter and excrete up to 15 liters of water per day, so overhydration is uncommon in normal circumstances. You'd have to drink gallons of water to suffer hyponatremia, especially if drinking fluids lacking proper electrolyte profiles.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer" style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">A: Children's water needs vary significantly by age. Infants 0-6 months need 700ml/day, 7-12 months need 800ml/day, 1-3 years need 1300ml/day, and 4-8 years need 1700ml/day. Older children need more: 9-13 year old girls need 2100ml/day and boys need 2400ml/day. Teenagers (14-18) need 2300ml/day for girls and 3300ml/day for boys. Children and elderly adults experience thirst less intensely, so ensure adequate hydration, especially during summer and physical activities.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer" style="color: #666; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">A: Yes! Water from food counts toward your total daily water intake. The Institute of Medicine estimates that approximately 81% of total water intake comes from beverages, while the remaining 19% comes from the water contained in food. This is why the calculator shows both "total water" (including food) and "water from beverages" separately. Foods like fruits, vegetables, soups, and even cooked grains contribute to your daily hydration.</p>
