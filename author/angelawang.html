        <h1>Angela Wang</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Founder &amp; Creator of CalculatorQuote</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Angela Wang is the founder of CalculatorQuote.</p>

            <p>In daily life, work, and learning, countless situations require calculation — whether it’s time, money, or the things we care about when we are simply living. Because of this, Angela had an idea: to build a website full of calculators. At the beginning, she mainly created traditional calculator pages. Later, she gradually realized that many real-life scenarios and many kinds of products could actually be turned into calculator pages as well.</p>

            <p>So rather than calling CalculatorQuote just a calculator quotation website, it is more accurate to say that it is a reflection of Angela’s real-life experiences, written as calculator tools. CalculatorQuote is still very young. It launched in June 2025, and the website has already grown to over 170+ tool pages and 20+ content pages. Every page is closely connected with real scenarios from Angela’s life, work, and interests.</p>

            <p>For example, when Angela was playing the <a href="../other/date-calculator.html">Blue Prince game</a>, there was a scenario where she needed to calculate the current date, so she created the <a href="../other/date-calculator.html">Date Calculator</a> page. Angela also loves watching table tennis games, so she built the <a href="../sports/ITTF-mixed-team-score-calculator.html">ITTF Mixed Team Score Calculator</a> to help fans calculate which national team can advance from the group stage and which teams may qualify. Since this mixed team format has only been implemented for about three years and has already been included in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games table tennis format, many spectators are still not very familiar with it. This tool helps them understand it better.</p>

            <p>Another example is the three very popular football pages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="../sports/football-goal-conversion-rate-calculator.html">Football Goal Conversion Rate Calculator</a></li>
                <li><a href="../sports/football-head-to-head-stats-comparison.html">Football Head-to-Head Stats Comparison</a></li>
                <li><a href="../sports/football-score-predictor-calculator.html">Football Score Predictor Calculator</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Angela never expected these pages to receive such high traffic. Judging from the keywords, many students seem to use them to predict scores or record match results. These sports tools truly come from Angela’s real sports experiences, which is why they belong to the Sports Calculators category.</p>

            <p>The <a href="../home/index.html">Home &amp; Garden calculators</a> also come from real life. Household services can be very expensive in many countries. Angela has personally experienced taking care of her front yard lawn, dealing with a broken fence after it was hit, and feeling helpless not knowing what to do. She has also experienced the trouble of carpets being ruined by her cats. These tools help people understand potential service costs before hiring someone, or estimate how much money they could save if they choose to do the work themselves.</p>

            <p>Angela also built the <a href="../pet/index.html">Pet Calculators</a> from her real-life experiences with cats and dogs.</p>

            <p>The <a href="../health/index.html">Health Calculators</a> reflect her concern for health: anti-inflammatory diets, Keto diet habits, nutrition intake, protein, vitamins, fat, fiber, sugar control, caffeine control, and even topics like hair loss risk possibly related to iron or omega-3 intake.</p>

            <p>There are also some interesting pages, such as <a href="../other/job-worth-calculator.html">Job Worth Calculator</a> to help you evaluate whether your current job is still worth continuing, as well as tools related to the holiday season. Angela also reads the Bible every day, so she created the <a href="../other/bible-reading-plan-calculator.html">Bible Reading Plan Calculator</a>, which helps people estimate how much they should read daily and how long it will take to finish the Bible.</p>

            <p>The tools on CalculatorQuote not only help people gain useful knowledge but also help them know how to respond when similar situations appear in real life.</p>

            <p>Angela does market research for every page she creates. Although the pages may not be absolutely perfect yet, they are continuously improving. If you have any suggestions for the website, you are very welcome to email Angela at: <a href="mailto:contact@calculatorquote.com">contact@calculatorquote.com</a>.</p>
