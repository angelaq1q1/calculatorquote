            7 Rules to Expand Your Lucky Surface in Your Career
        </div>

        <h1>7 Rules to Expand Your Lucky Surface in Your Career</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hey, I'm Zara. Looking back at my career, it sometimes feels like luck just fell into my lap—but the truth is, most of what looked like "random luck" was actually something I consciously worked on.</p>

            <p>Right after college, I started thinking of luck like a simple formula: luck = surface area × probability. Seriously, you could even take out a <a href="../math/basic-calculator.html">Basic Calculator</a> and play around with it—just to see how increasing your "surface area" changes the chances. If you stay in a tiny circle, not sharing your work or meeting new people, your probability of "getting lucky" is tiny. But if you show up more, share your ideas, and expand your circle, the opportunities start multiplying.</p>

            <p>Take my first big break, for example. I landed a job at a VC firm right after college. On the surface, it looked random, but it wasn't. The partners had read an article I wrote during my journalism internship. That one piece of work got me noticed. My "surface area" had been small until then—just a couple of articles online—but that was enough to put me on someone's radar at the right time.</p>

            <p>A few years later, I joined ByteDance. Again, it seemed like luck. But really, I had spent my VC years connecting startups across China and the US and had shared my projects online. Someone saw what I was doing and thought, "Zara's exactly what we need." That formula—surface area × probability—was working again. I had made my work visible, increased my "surface area," and bam—luck found me.</p>

            <p>Later, I pivoted to AI. Back then, people around me didn't really understand why I was tinkering with AI tools and openly sharing notes. But when an AI project came up internally, I was the first person colleagues thought of—because I'd already shown my interest and skill publicly. Luck, in that moment, felt more like inevitability than randomness.</p>

            <p>Here's what I've learned: just working hard in silence isn't enough. You can be insanely talented and still invisible to the people who can change your career trajectory. Being good is not enough; people have to see that you're good.</p>

            <p>So how do you expand your "luck surface area"? I've got seven rules that I follow every day:</p>

            <h2>1. Create Publicly</h2>
            <p>"Don't hide your experiments." That's my daily reminder. Share your learning, side projects, failures, even tiny insights. Once, I posted a small AI demo online. An old friend shared it, and a startup founder in their network reached out. A few days later, I was consulting on a project. Every little thing you put out into the world increases your "surface area."</p>

            <h2>2. Expand Your Circle</h2>
            <p>Networking doesn't have to be forced. The best opportunities often come from "weak connections"—friends of friends, someone who liked your post online, a colleague in a different department. Every new person you meet slightly grows your probability of hitting the right opportunity at the right time.</p>

            <h2>3. Show Up</h2>
            <p>"Just show up." Sounds simple, right? But so many chances hide where you're least likely to go. Attend an event, comment on a post, help a friend test a product. You never know which small action will be a turning point. I almost skipped an internal AI project one afternoon—but going there changed my path completely.</p>

            <h2>4. Document Your Wins and Lessons</h2>
            <p>Keep track of your small wins and failures. I journal every little project I try, even the ones that flop. Not only does this help me reflect, but sharing these lessons publicly often sparks conversations and connections I wouldn't expect. Sometimes people reach out just to say, "I tried this too!" That opens doors.</p>

            <h2>5. Volunteer Strategically</h2>
            <p>Offer your help without immediate gain. Reviewing someone's pitch deck, beta-testing a tool, mentoring a junior colleague—these actions may seem small but increase visibility. One time I gave feedback on a side project, and months later, that person recommended me for a new role.</p>

            <h2>6. Share Your Opinions, Not Just Work</h2>
            <p>Don't just show what you made—share what you think. Writing short posts, commenting in forums, or speaking at events about your perspectives puts your name out there. People remember those who have strong, thoughtful opinions. I've had multiple project invites come from people noticing my commentary, not my products.</p>

            <h2>7. Iterate Publicly</h2>
            <p>Don't wait for perfect work to be seen. Sharing your experiments early—even messy drafts—invites feedback, creates connections, and accelerates learning. One unfinished tool I shared online sparked collaboration that led to a major internal project. Had I waited to "polish it," the chance would've passed.</p>

            <p>Luck isn't fair—it depends on starting points, geography, and resources—but everyone can calculate the best "return" on their constraints. Every article, every project, every new connection grows your surface area. And when opportunity knocks, it finds you.</p>

            <p>So here's my diary-style advice: don't just wait for luck. Go make it. Show up, share, connect, create. The more people who know how capable you are, the more likely it is you'll be the first person they think of when opportunity arrives. Then, when it does, you won't think, "Wow, lucky me." You'll think, "Of course—I made this happen."</p>
